2. First Rectangle
mandatory
Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base:

In the file models/rectangle.py
Class Rectangle inherits from Base
Private instance attributes, each with its own public getter and setter:
__width -> width
__height -> height
__x -> x
__y -> y
Class constructor: def __init__(self, width, height, x=0, y=0, id=None):
Call the super class with id - this super call with use the logic of the __init__ of the Base class
Assign each argument width, height, x and y to the right attribute
Why private attributes with getter/setter? Why not directly public attribute?

Because we want to protect attributes of our class. With a setter, you are able to validate what a developer is trying to assign to a variable. So after, in your class you can “trust” these attributes.
